This repository contain all the python learning along with advanced concepets of python.

✅ 1. Data Structures – Matlab kya hai?
Sochiye aapke paas cheezain store karni hain — jaise:
Naam ka list
Numbers ka group
School ke students ke records
Ya ek game ka score board

Data Structure matlab:
“Data ko store karne ka tarika.”

Jese hum:
Kitaabein almari mein rakhte hain
Files folder mein
Paise wallet mein

Waise hi programming mein hum data ko rakhte hain in structures:
List (jaise ek shopping list)
Dictionary (jaise ek phonebook)
Stack (jaise plates ka stack)
Queue (jaise line mein log)
Tree, Graph (complex tarike)

✅ 2. Algorithms – Kya hota hai?
Agar data store ho gaya, ab sawaal yeh hai:
“Is data ke saath kaam kaise karna hai?”

Jaise:
Koi naam dhoondhna
Sabse bara number nikalna
Data ko sort karna (chhote se bara)
Yeh sab algorithms ke zariye hota hai —

“Algorithm matlab ek step-by-step tareeqa kisi problem ko solve karne ka.”

Jaise:
Recipe banana (har step likha hota hai)
Sorting method (Bubble sort, Merge sort)
Searching method (Linear, Binary search)

🔁 3. DSA Together – Kya faida hai?

Ab sochiye:
Agar aapko data efficiently store bhi karna hai (Data Structure)
Aur us par fast kaam bhi karna hai (Algorithm)
Toh aapko dono ka combination seekhna hoga — jise kehte hain:
DSA = Data Structures + Algorithms

🧠 4. Real-Life Example:
Problem: Aapko apni class ke students ke names sort karne hain (A-Z).

Aap kaun sa data structure use karenge? → List
Aap kaun sa algorithm use karenge? → Sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble sort, Quick sort)

Agar aap best combination choose karenge, toh aapka code:
Fast chalega
Memory bachayega
Smart tareeke se kaam karega

🎯 Summary:
Topic	Easy Definition
Data Structure	Data store karne ka tarika
Algorithm	Problem solve karne ka step-by-step plan
DSA	Best combo of both for efficient coding

Data Structures
Data Structures are a way of storing and organizing data in a computer.

Python has built-in support for several data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.

Other data structures can be implemented using Python classes and objects, such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

In this Repository we will concentrate on these Data Structures:

Lists and Arrays
Stacks
Queues
Linked Lists
Hash Tables
Trees
Binary Trees
Binary Search Trees
AVL Trees
Graphs

Algorithms

Algorithms are a way of working with data in a computer and solving problems like sorting, searching, etc.

In this tutorial we will concentrate on these search and sort Algorithms:

Linear Search
Binary Search
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Quick Sort
Counting Sort
Radix Sort
Merge Sort
